# Tooth Bone Level Detection Using Machine Learning
### In this project, I worked on detecting the tooth bone level using machine learning. The process involved data annotation, model training, and evaluation to ensure accurate results.

## Data Annotation
### For data annotation, I used Roboflow, which I found to be more efficient and user-friendly compared to other annotation tools. Roboflow provides an intuitive interface, supports multiple data formats, and speeds up the annotation process, making it ideal for deep learning projects.

### The dataset included dental X-rays and images where the tooth bone level needed to be labeled. Proper annotation was crucial for training the model effectively.

## Data Training
#### For training, I used the Kaggle terminal, mainly because Kaggle provides access to two free GPUs, which significantly improves training speed and performance. The availability of high-performance GPUs allowed me to train my model faster and achieve better accuracy compared to training on a local machine or using other cloud-based solutions.

- The training process involved:
    - Preprocessing the annotated images
    - Using a deep learning model (e.g., CNN or YOLO) to detect the tooth bone level
    - Fine-tuning hyperparameters for better accuracy
    - Evaluating the model using test data
#### After completing the training, Kaggle provided me with a trained model, which I then deployed on my local computer for further testing and validation.

## Final Results
### After multiple training iterations and optimizations, the final model achieved an accuracy of 80% in detecting the tooth bone level. This result demonstrates the potential of machine learning in dental imaging and diagnosis.
- In the future, I plan to:
    - Increase the dataset size to improve model performance
    - Use more advanced architectures for better accuracy
    - Optimize inference speed for real-time applications

### This project highlights the effectiveness of machine learning in dental analysis, and I look forward to making further improvements.
